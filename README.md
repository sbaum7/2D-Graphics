# 2D Graphics

A collection of Python scripts for image processing and animation effects using PIL (Python Imaging Library).

## Scripts

- `Saturation.py` - Adjusts image saturation levels
- `MovieSaturation.py` - Creates an animation that oscillates between saturation levels
- `MovieRotateAndSat.py` - Combines rotation and saturation changes in an animation
- `Vignette.py` - Applies a vignette effect to images

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PIL (Pillow)
- NumPy (for rotation animations)

## Usage

Each script can be run independently. Example:

```bash
python Vignette.py
python MovieSaturation.py
```

Input images should be placed in the same directory as the scripts.
